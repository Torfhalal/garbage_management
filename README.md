# garbage_management
The first Symfony application I made (HUGGII entry test)

Needs:
- User can create a garbage ✅
- While create, a PDF file is create (named BSD) and can be preview/download ❌ (Environment problem, will be fixed soon)
- Garbage list page ✅
- User can order garbages by submit date ✅
- User can order garbages by treatment request date ❌ (Need to done it with Ajax cause no refresh allowed)
